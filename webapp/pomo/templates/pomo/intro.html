      <p>
        Congratulations on taking your first step into the world of magic and focus! At Arcadia, you’ll navigate through a magical school using an enchanted map. The map shows different locations, such as the Library, Great Hall, and Gardens, each offering unique events or tasks for you to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you choose an event, you’ll embark on a challenge tied to the Pomodoro technique. This means you’ll focus on your studies in the real world while the magic of Arcadia helps you stay motivated. A timer will guide your session—25 minutes of focused work, followed by a short break. Once the timer is complete, you’ll return to the story, discovering what happens next and potentially unlocking new events or locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, some events are only available for a limited time or may affect what happens next in your journey. Choose wisely and stay committed to mastering both your studies and the magic of Arcadia.
